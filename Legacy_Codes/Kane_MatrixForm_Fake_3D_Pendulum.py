# ------------------------------------------ SCRIPT OBJECTIVE --------------------------------------------------------- #

# The objective of this script is to derive the eq. of motion of a system by applying kane's algorithm.

# The script will be adjusted case by case by the user, following the instruction prompted on the terminal

# Kane's algorithm stars by defining the position vectors of the center of mass of the bodies, and then
# derive them along time to obtain the velocity and acceleration vectors for the two points.
# We then derive the partial velocity vectors from the total velocity vectors of the two center of mass, and then
# we proceed to calculate the generalized forces acting on our system.
# We then proceed to assemble's kane's eq. of motion to obtain, by symplification, the eq of motion of the system.

# This is going to be version 1 of "Kane's method matrix form rearranged"
